# Sorting App

### About

This was a project/challenge from a TypeScript course that emphasizes good design patterns. The task was to build a sorting application that is flexible enough to handle various data types, such as `number[]`, `string`, and `LinkedList`, without writing repetitive code.

### Key Takeaways

-   Interfaces and abstract classes help in producing clean, maintainable, and type-safe code. They can be used as a substitute for type-guarding to avoid unnecessary `if` statements and repetitive code.
-   Use abstract classes when you want to build up a definition of an object.
-   Use interfaces when you have very dissimilar objects that you want to work together.
